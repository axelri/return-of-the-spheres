A new version of the already old fluffy spheres codebase. More to come!

# Some things to work on
* Screw the physics engine! Use [PyODE](http://pyode.sourceforge.net/) instead!
    - Make input affect the physics engine in a nice way
    - Convert all in-game objects to objects for the phys engine
* Text on screen while the graphics engine is running
* Menus!
* Work out the level file format, should be human readable (YAML?)
* Try to work on a world editor
    - Keyboard, mouse support? Use rays in that case
    - Maybe able to load textures and apply those
    - Set starting position
* The _meaning_? Goals, event system etc
* (Check up on the math code, maybe switch to NumPy)
